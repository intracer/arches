    <p>On this page you will see all of the Cards that this Resource Model currently uses. Because each Card corresponds to a specific Branch, this is also a list of all the Branches in the model. You can even add new Branches to the Resource Model directly from this page, just click "Add Card" and make a selection. Note that from here you can only add a Branch that already has its Card configured. To add a Branch that doesn't yet have a Card, you must use the Graph Manager.</p>

    <p>When a Card is added, it comes with its initial configurations from the Branch level. However, you can further customize it to meet any special needs for this particular Resource Model. For example, you may want to change the label of a "Name" field to "Building Name", or modify the Card's help text. To do so, click on the Card and you will be brought to the Card Designer.</p>
